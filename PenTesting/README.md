### Every application has vulnerabilities which range from:
```
	* insecure login
	* hardcoding issues
	* insecure data storage==> How Data is stored inside the mobile device through mobile app
	* input validation issues

	Most mobile apps store the data in plain text in clear text within the storage device.
	Anyone who has access to the mobile application storage will have the ability to view the 
	ENTIRE DATA

	Your credentials are stored in a token within the system. 

	I go back to the Windows Terminal and do this:

```

```console
C:\Users\OmarBelkady>adb devices
```

```console
C:\Users\omarbelkady> adb shell
omarbelkady_x86:/ $ whoami
shell
omarbelkady_x86:/ $ exit
```

The whoami command should output shell

Now I authenticate myself as the root user
```console
C:\Users\omarbelkady>adb root
```


```console
C:\Users\omarbelkady>adb root
C:\Users\omarbelkady>adb shell
```

Now if I run the command whoami this will display root
I now navigate to the /data/data directory and display the file
I want the jakhar.aseem.div dir
```bash
cd /data/data
ls
cd jakhar.aseem.diva/
ls -l
cd shared-prefs
ls -l
```

Most files will be stored in an xml format or an sqlite file I run the command cat on the xml file

```bash
cat fName.lName.diva_preferences.xml
```
I see the credentials as following:
<map>
	<string name="password">test</string>
	<string name="user">test</string>
</map>

```bash
cd ..
cd databases
cat divanotes.db
cat divanotes.db-shm
cat divanotes.db-wal
```
The last command provided me with text messages
